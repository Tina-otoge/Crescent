# :moon: Crescent
Linux Desktop entries generator

# What are Desktop entries?
Specification: [freedesktop.org](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)  
Information: [ArchWiki/Desktop_entries](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_entries)

# Why generating them?
I like to add a lot of entries which are not actual applications. Writting them by hand is tiring. Quite often, lots of them are similar. But having them helps me launch programs faster using my application launcher.

# How does this solve the problem?
Crescent adds the ability to define user-land apps in a more maintanable fashion. It parses a JSON-formatted list and will ensure your applications folder is in sync with what's in the list.

You can also define application templates which solves the problem of creating similar entries.

# How does it work?

Crescent reads 2 configuration files. `apps.json` and `templates.json`. The names are explicit.

`apps.json` example:
```json
{
	"TweetDeck": {
		"template": "Chromeapp",
		"templating": {
			"url": "https://tweetdeck.twitter.com"
		}
	}
}
```
`templates.json` example:
```json
{
	"Chromeapp": {
		"Icon": "google-chrome",
		"Terminal": false,
		"templating": {
			"Exec": "google-chrome --app=\"{url}\""
		}
	}
}
```
Generated `TweetDeck.desktop` file:
```desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=TweetDeck
Exec=google-chrome --app="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com"
Icon=google-chrome
Terminal=false
```

# How to install it?

## Linux
Head to the [Releases page][releaes] and download the latest `crescent-linux-compressed-python-executable`, rename it to something more convenient (e.g., `crescent`) and place it somewhere in your PATH (e.g.,`~/.local/bin`)

## Cross-platform
I don't think this makes any sense since Desktop Entries are probably a Linux only thing... but Crescent should be able to write the generated files on any platform.

Download the latest stable version of the source code from the [Releases page][releases], run it with `python3 path/to/the/folder`.
